# Console-Finances

## Description
The project at hand is to use the concepts I've learned during class to complete the activity and to use this knowledge to create a code that calculates the financial records of a company. 


## How it went
When creating the first part of the javascript (part 1 of the challenge) I was able to see it reflected in the Javascript. As I went on to write the pseudocode for the next challenge, I believed I was on the correct path, but then was presented with an error so none of my challenge could be seen in the console log.
Unfortunately, I ran out of time and struggled with rectifying this. In future javascript projects, I will allow myself enough time to try and complete them, along with leaving room to troubleshoot these issues. As maths is not my strong suit, I really struggled with understanding what was being asked of me in the challenges. I will be taking a deeper dive in my personal time to continue to educate myself on javascript concepts, and hope to improve. On a positive note, I did do some pseudocode that hopefully shows some understanding of these concepts learned.
